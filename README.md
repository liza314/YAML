# A basic concept on YAML

**Before starting with YAML here is some concept of serialization**

## **SERIALIZATION**
---------------------
It is a process of translating data structure/object in a format for storage purpose. The storage format later can be used to reconstruct into original object. The bits order in serialization can be used to create semantically identical clone. Marshalling is the process of object serialization. **Deserialization** is extracting a data structure from a series of bytes, opposite of serialization.
